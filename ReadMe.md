## Local setup

- Open a minecraft world in `1.21.1`. A list of supported versions by Mineflayer can be found [here](https://github.com/PrismarineJS/mineflayer/blob/master/lib/version.js#L1)
- Open the game to lan with the port `25565`
- Run `npm i`
- Run `npm run start`

## Concept

### Potential changes
- for long actions evaluate state shortly later instead of after full action
